    <h1>Feedback is caring!!</h1> <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      </br>
      I have this image of myself reflected on a dark window, red eyes and my hair looking like a muffin top. Who is that guy!</br>
      After 5 hours of tackling numbers and writing code it was really funny to see my self alone and after such a long period of time of absolute silence.</br>
      <br>
      Well actually was kind of sad... I couldnt talk to any body about this crazy loop, this weird iterator, or about classes and objects.</br>
      Actually, Im lying, a friend who was visiting for a month and my wife where there, but all this is Chinese for them.</br>
      <br>
      So the other day... there I was, in front of my computer having a long talk on how to solve one of those problems that </br>
      I used to teach my self and have a monologue about it, but this time with another human.</br>
      A cool, interesting, fun and smart human being.</br>
      <br>
      Yes, there are a lot of us wanting to learn, experiment, write code and on top of that wanting to talk about it, debate and share.</br>
      So far, pairing is the most fun and exiting thing about DBC.</br>
      Some times it is hard because everyone has it own personality and its shown really easily when pairing but by understanding the philosophy behind everything kind of gets smooth and really beneficial.
      I think my school was wrong about lot of more things now.

      <h3>Do you want to Super Size your Sh*t Sandwich?</h3>
      <br>
      I think feedback its and art, some people are natural. They can give and receive feedback being constructive, kind, and without </br>
      inviting your to their favorite Sh*t Sandwich restaurant.</br>
      <br>
      But there are some others like me that we need to master this art. And there is nothing better than practice.</br>
      Im really glad to be exposed to this intensive feedback environment. Its something that us as a generation demand and we have to be good at both, receiving and giving it.
