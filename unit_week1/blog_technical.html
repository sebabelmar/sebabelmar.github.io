            <h3>Loops</h3>
            <br>
            If there is something that computer programmers like to do not do, it is to repeat the same thing several times.</br>
            </br>
            That is why from the very beginning this was kind of the whole point of creating computers. Why calculating this over and over again?? </br>
            what if we teach a dog how to do it. </br>
            </br>
            Well instead of dog training, humans created computers. It was easy to fall in an infinite loop back in the day and end up unplugging the dog to stop it. </br>
            </br>
            Today Ruby makes looping easy and intuitive.</br>
            </br>
            LOOPS: execute the same block of code a specific number of times.</br>
            </br>
            SYNTAX OF SOME LOOPS</br>
            </br>
            While: executes code while conditional is true.</br>
            </br>
            while conditional [do]   </br> 
              code </br>
            end</br>
            </br>
            ----------------------</br>
            code while condition</br>
            ----------------------</br>
            </br>
            begin </br>   
              code  </br>
            end while conditional</br>
            </br>

            Until: executes code while conditional is false.</br>
            </br>
            until conditional [do]   </br> 
              code</br> 
            end</br>
            </br>
            -----------------------</br>
            code until conditional  </br> 
            -----------------------</br>
            </br>
            </br>
            begin </br>   
              code </br>
            end until conditional</br>
            </br>
            For: executes code once for each element in the expression.</br>
            </br>
            for variable [, variable ...] in expression [do]  </br>  
              code </br>
            end</br>
            </br>

            The challenge here is to define the specific number of times that we want to execute and obviously what code the want to be executed.</br>
            </br>
            Which one to use will depend on how do you like to set the conditional and just execute some code (while, until), if you are going to loop over a </br>
            Hash or an Array without creating  new scope for local variables (for) or if you want to execute related to a sequence of numbers (for).</br>
            </br>
            The statement above is just an interpretation you can experiment with them, but as important it is to understand how this different </br>
            loops work is to understand what iterator variables and the conditionals are:</br>
            </br>
            Defining and understanding iterators;</br>
            An iterator is a variable that will increase or decrees in order to count how many times the code has been repeated.</br>
            This variable usually define equal to 0 or 1 outside the loop and increase =+ 1 every time the code is executed. Is not weird to use it </br>
            counting backwards or counting in a different scale. But the final idea is to use this in the conditional that stops the loop and some times in the </br>
            code that you want to execute i (iterators) times.</br>
            </br>
            Defining and understanding conditional;</br>
            Loops go on until the conditional is true or false. This is why you use the iterator and a conditional when setting up a loop.</br>
            On loops like each they stop when they have no more elements to pass into the code so we can say they have an automatic break.</br>
            Break, redo, retry, next and retry_if are statements that you can use inside your loops in order to control its performance giving </br>
            you some independence from the conditional.

            <h3>JavaScript != JAVA</h3>
            <br>
            - Ahhhhh... your IPA on tap please. 24oz. </br>
            - Well while we wait for the 3rd wheel do you want to hear something that will blow your mind? </br>
            </br>
            JavaScript it is a really popular programming language!
            </br>
            Let me tell you why. 
            </br>
            </br>
            First JAVA is not JavaScript. They are different breads.</br>
            </br>
            Java is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language">Compiled</a> programming language and JavaScript is a, guess... yes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">Scripting</a> one.</br>
            The difference between Compiled and Scripting is huge.</br> 
            </br>
            When you use a compiling language your code has to be compiled by a special program call compiler.</br> A compiler changes your code into a language that machine can understand. With a compiler language you dont run the code that you make but the result of the compiled process, which is a new file. A new file delivered from the compiler. Confused???</br>
            </br>
            On the other hand, with Scripting language you dont need a compiler but you need an interpreter. Every browser is an interpreter and they can easily read line-by-line code that you write in JavaScript and work with it.</br>
            </br>
            With a compiler you need to run separate compile process for Windows, Mac or Linux, but you can run JavaScript on any browser and it does not matter in which OS.</br>
            </br>
            My friend dont you think I could be the most popular guy if I speak one language that girls of any culture can understand??</br>
            </br>
            And in top of that, you can do <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/things-you-didnt-know-javascript-could-do-6122835">all this kind of things</a> using JavaScript, which by the way, is an Object Oriented programming language easy to learn and light to run.

            <h3>Comparing Web sites</h3>
            <br>
            <h4><a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a></h4>
            Is one of my favorites websites because it let me discover shorts and documentaries that I could never find other way. It is easy to use and they have staff picking good material and artists for you. Their recommendations are fantastic and usually takes your to some unexplored corner of reality or fantasy.<br>
            I love the elegant way that the videos Meta data is displayed and how people really interact around it.<br>
            Vimeo makes my day several times a week.<br>
            Compare to Youtube I find Vimeo more relaxing to use, less add, less consumer hunting oriented and really whiling to help artists to improve or people to start doing good art.

            <br/>
            <h4><a href="http://liftinteractive.com/">Liftinteractive</a></h4>
            These guys came up with an awesome way to use CSS. They are an agency and they are trying to educate their clients on what they do.<br> 
            They make it really simple, elegant and pretty. I feel really engage with this guys vision and mission just by putting my eyes on their index. A full-page picture showing the culture, relax environment and professionalism.<br>
            They use the word LEARN. Learn more about us. Study us. Hire us.<br>
            I like their simplicity and the way they display their information. Their colors are not dark at all and matches with their life style or a least with my interpretation of it.

            <br/>
            <h4><a href="http://www.sedonahotyoga.com/">Sedona Hot Yoga</a></h4>
            I use this website every week to check on schedule, classes, teachers and if there are any cancelation. Thats why is one of my favorites; they update it every week at least two times. And they have a Mobil version!<br>
            But their colors scheme is terrible. It stress me out, I dont like vising this website but I have to. I think it has basic design and it doesnt engage. For me it doesnt communicate their values as a yoga studio.<br>
            The way they display information is has a huge lack of elegancy.
