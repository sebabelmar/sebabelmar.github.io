    <h1>Values === Hapiness</h1> <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    I see happiness as way to go, as a state of mind that I can choose and not as something that I have to achieve. I can feel exited, motivated and think that, that is happiness or I can miss my family and think that Im feeling unhappy.</br>
    </br>
    But in order be or go happy, I think I have to create the conditions to that. 
    Creating those conditions makes me feel proud and by the pillars that sustain my pride I can go to sleep satisfied.
    I can remember moments of my life that all those factors came together and collide in one event or day, like my wedding.  Or like the day I knew my wife was pregnant or the first time I heard my babys heart beating.</br>
    </br>
    This are some of values that help me create conditions to go happy in life:</br>
    </br>
    Wisdom</br>
    Responsibility</br>
    Close Relationships</br>
    Community</br>
    Creativity</br>
    Nature</br>

    </br>
    I feel that RESPONSIBILITY is one of the values that keeps me calm, focus, secure and let me go happy. When I assume the responsibility of my decisions I can die happy doing what Ive decided to do. I know that Ive chosen the right path that leads me to where my heart wants to go. I might be wrong, but I have that milestone to go back to, and re evaluate if Im in the right path. All this because there was a point back there in time, that I consciously decided to load my back pack with that RESPONSIBILITY and it will be always available for me.</br>
    </br>
    One thing is to say, and other one is to do. I try but actually I live those values in a scale 1-5 like this:</br>
    </br>
    Wisdom 3</br>
    Responsibility 4</br>
    Close Relationships 4</br>
    Community 3</br>
    Creativity 4</br>
    Nature 4</br>
    </br>
    Because there are some values that is hard to work on or to actually achieve, plus 5 is perfection and I dont have to be perfect :)</br>
    </br>
    </br>
    Do you want to know the last topic that someone asked me advice on?</br>
    </br>
    YOGA; one of my friend was going to different YOGA classes, different teachers and different kinds of YOGA. He asked me what was my opinion on Kundalini Yoga.
    Ive practice a lot of Kundalini with different teachers from different parts of the world.So we had a nice open conversation about it and he got my perspective on that topic.
