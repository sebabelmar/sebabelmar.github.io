            <h3>Feedback is caring!!</h3>
            </br>
            I have this image of myself reflected on a dark window, red eyes and my hair looking like a muffin top. Who is that guy!</br>
            After 5 hours of tackling numbers and writing code it was really funny to see my self alone and after such a long period of time of absolute silence.</br>
            Well actually was kind of sad… I couldn’t talk to any body about this crazy loop, this weird iterator, or about classes and objects.</br>
            Actually, I’m lying, a friend who was visiting for a month and my wife where there, but all this is Chinese for them.</br>
            So the other day… there I was, in front of my computer having a long talk on how to solve one of those problems that </br>
            I used to teach my self and have a monologue about it, but this time with another human.</br>
            A cool, interesting, fun and smart human bean.</br>
            Yes, there are a lot of us wanting to learn, experiment, write code and on top of that wanting to talk about it, debate and share.</br>
            So far, pairing is the most fun and exiting thing about DBC.</br>
            Some times it is hard because everyone has it own personality and it’s shown really easily when pairing but by understanding the philosophy behind everything kind of gets smooth and really beneficial.
            I think my school was wrong about lot of more things now.

            <h3>Do you want to Super Size your Sh*t Sandwich?</h3>
            I think feedback its and art, some people are natural. They can give and receive feedback being constructive, kind, and without </br>
            inviting your to their favorite Sh*t Sandwich restaurant.</br>
            But there are some others like me that we need to master this art. And there is nothing better than practice.</br>
            I’m really glad to be exposed to this intensive feedback environment. It’s something that us as a generation demand and </br>
            we have to be good at both, receiving and giving it.

            <h3>Values === Hapiness</h3>
            </br>
            I see happiness as way to go, as a state of mind that I can choose and not as something that I have to achieve. I can feel exited, motivated and think that, that is happiness or I can miss my family and think that Im feeling unhappy.</br>
            </br>
            But in order be or go happy, I think I have to create the conditions to that. 
            Creating those conditions makes me feel proud and by the pillars that sustain my pride I can go to sleep satisfied.
            I can remember moments of my life that all those factors came together and collide in one event or day, like my wedding.  Or like the day I knew my wife was pregnant or the first time I heard my babys heart beating.</br>
            </br>
            This are some of values that help me create conditions to go happy in life:</br>
            </br>
            Wisdom</br>
            Responsibility</br>
            Close Relationships</br>
            Community</br>
            Creativity</br>
            Nature</br>

            </br>
            I feel that RESPONSIBILITY is one of the values that keeps me calm, focus, secure and let me go happy. When I assume the responsibility of my decisions I can die happy doing what Ive decided to do. I know that Ive chosen the right path that leads me to where my heart wants to go. I might be wrong, but I have that milestone to go back to, and re evaluate if Im in the right path. All this because there was a point back there in time, that I consciously decided to load my back pack with that RESPONSIBILITY and it will be always available for me.</br>
            </br>
            One thing is to say, and other one is to do. I try but actually I live those values in a scale 1-5 like this:</br>
            </br>
            Wisdom 3</br>
            Responsibility 4</br>
            Close Relationships 4</br>
            Community 3</br>
            Creativity 4</br>
            Nature 4</br>
            </br>
            Because there are some values that is hard to work on or to actually achieve, plus 5 is perfection and I dont have to be perfect :)</br>
            </br>
            </br>
            Do you want to know the last topic that someone asked me advice on?</br>
            </br>
            YOGA; one of my friend was going to different YOGA classes, different teachers and different kinds of YOGA. He asked me what was my opinion on Kundalini Yoga.
            I’ve practice a lot of Kundalini with different teachers from different parts of the world. So we had a nice open conversation about it and he got my perspective on that topic.
