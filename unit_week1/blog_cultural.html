            <h3>Conflicts can be Good</h3>
            </br>

            I like emotional conflicts when they are deep and meaningful. Im not scared to face one of these ones because</br>
            I try to approach them calm. Few times Ive found my self, calm like a lake in a summer morning, while someone</br>
            is really angry gelling at me. Some others yes, I can feel the adrenaline.</br>
            </br>
            Sounds weird but I grew up in a small town in Argentina, where emotional conflicts and people solving them by</br> 
            screaming and going super loud with their body language was something normal. Something we deal with every single</br> 
            day and pretty much everywhere. At school or the super market. At the plaza or OMG at a soccer field.</br>
            Because of that I realized that when I had to solve a conflict or I was in the middle of one I used to let it go</br> 
            to it extreme.</br>
            </br> 
            Now I know is not healthy. I dont do it any more, even knowing that the lesson can be better if that happened.</br>
            </br>
            I lived for 3 years with 3 brothers in an apartment in Santiago. We became really good friends and I was kind of the 4th brother.</br>
            </br>
            One of my friends was getting ready to move from Santiago to New York after an intense period of an internship in a bank.</br>
            In that same period of time I was experimenting something that is hard to describe but kind of realizing how much</br> 
            damage I was doing to my self by the way I was eating, drinking, parting and dealing with some social interactions</br> 
            and my friends where kind of worry about me. Why Seba is not drunk?</br>
            </br>
            My friends, being at that time close-minded to his perspective didnt understand any of my point of views.</br>
            Right before he left our country was in the middle of the biggest student strike and the smell of family and friend</br> 
            getting divided by political and social schools of thought was in the air again. Coming back from the 70s.</br>
            So, whenever we have any political, social, environmental conversation I tried to use the most extreme arguments to</br> 
            talk to my friend. I was trying to make the point that even thinking different friends and family shouldnt take</br> 
            this emotionally because that was dangerous.</br> 
            </br>
            But my friend insisted in argue instead of debating.</br> 
            </br>
            One night, tired of my friend, I just look him in the eyes and ask him to move ASAP to NYC and stay there plus some other ironic and</br> hurtful things.</br> 
            </br>
            That was very bad, bad decision. </br>
            </br>
            I learned that there are some topics that each one can choose to have an opinion about it and others that your mind set is actually</br> set by circumstances, family, culture and there is nothing wrong with it.</br>
            I learned that tolerance is a must in any relation and even a neutral position can be offensive for others.</br>
            Days went by and we had the chance to talk, this time to say good-bye. I told him that I was intentionally provoking him whenever he</br> 
            was talking about those topics, just to give him a face of somebody who respect him and love him but thinks different.</br>
            I told him that in a workplace like NYC the diversity of people, culture and opinions require a bigger range of tolerance from my perspective.</br>
            And even being something that I thought it could help him, was my opinion and I didnt have the right to bring it out the way I did.</br>
            </br>
            I apologize and learned.</br>
            </br>
            Today I looked back and a sober, open and real conversation about those topics can really help. Trying to give some one a life lesson is not</br> something that a friend should try to do the way I did. I think it’s selfish at the end of the day and absolutely puts in risk any friendship.</br>

            <h3>Feedback is caring!!</h3>
            </br>
            I have this image of myself reflected on a dark window, red eyes and my hair looking like a muffin top. Who is that guy!</br>
            After 5 hours of tackling numbers and writing code it was really funny to see my self alone and after such a long period of time of absolute silence.</br>
            Well actually was kind of sad... I couldnt talk to any body about this crazy loop, this weird iterator, or about classes and objects.</br>
            Actually, Im lying, a friend who was visiting for a month and my wife where there, but all this is Chinese for them.</br>
            So the other day... there I was, in front of my computer having a long talk on how to solve one of those problems that </br>
            I used to teach my self and have a monologue about it, but this time with another human.</br>
            A cool, interesting, fun and smart human bean.</br>
            Yes, there are a lot of us wanting to learn, experiment, write code and on top of that wanting to talk about it, debate and share.</br>
            So far, pairing is the most fun and exiting thing about DBC.</br>
            Some times it is hard because everyone has it own personality and its shown really easily when pairing but by understanding the philosophy behind everything kind of gets smooth and really beneficial.
            I think my school was wrong about lot of more things now.

            <h3>Do you want to Super Size your Sh*t Sandwich?</h3>
            I think feedback its and art, some people are natural. They can give and receive feedback being constructive, kind, and without </br>
            inviting your to their favorite Sh*t Sandwich restaurant.</br>
            But there are some others like me that we need to master this art. And there is nothing better than practice.</br>
            Im really glad to be exposed to this intensive feedback environment. Its something that us as a generation demand and </br>
            we have to be good at both, receiving and giving it.

            <h3>Values === Hapiness</h3>
            </br>
            I see happiness as way to go, as a state of mind that I can choose and not as something that I have to achieve. I can feel exited, motivated and think that, that is happiness or I can miss my family and think that Im feeling unhappy.</br>
            </br>
            But in order be or go happy, I think I have to create the conditions to that. 
            Creating those conditions makes me feel proud and by the pillars that sustain my pride I can go to sleep satisfied.
            I can remember moments of my life that all those factors came together and collide in one event or day, like my wedding.  Or like the day I knew my wife was pregnant or the first time I heard my babys heart beating.</br>
            </br>
            This are some of values that help me create conditions to go happy in life:</br>
            </br>
            Wisdom</br>
            Responsibility</br>
            Close Relationships</br>
            Community</br>
            Creativity</br>
            Nature</br>

            </br>
            I feel that RESPONSIBILITY is one of the values that keeps me calm, focus, secure and let me go happy. When I assume the responsibility of my decisions I can die happy doing what Ive decided to do. I know that Ive chosen the right path that leads me to where my heart wants to go. I might be wrong, but I have that milestone to go back to, and re evaluate if Im in the right path. All this because there was a point back there in time, that I consciously decided to load my back pack with that RESPONSIBILITY and it will be always available for me.</br>
            </br>
            One thing is to say, and other one is to do. I try but actually I live those values in a scale 1-5 like this:</br>
            </br>
            Wisdom 3</br>
            Responsibility 4</br>
            Close Relationships 4</br>
            Community 3</br>
            Creativity 4</br>
            Nature 4</br>
            </br>
            Because there are some values that is hard to work on or to actually achieve, plus 5 is perfection and I dont have to be perfect :)</br>
            </br>
            </br>
            Do you want to know the last topic that someone asked me advice on?</br>
            </br>
            YOGA; one of my friend was going to different YOGA classes, different teachers and different kinds of YOGA. He asked me what was my opinion on Kundalini Yoga.
            I’ve practice a lot of Kundalini with different teachers from different parts of the world. So we had a nice open conversation about it and he got my perspective on that topic.
