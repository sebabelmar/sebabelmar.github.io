    Hi! I am Seba Belmar, originally from Chile, I left South America almost two years ago to begin a career shift and an exploration into myself. I realized that the world is changing at light speed, and the ones that are making those changes are not big corporations, politicians or international leaders. The people who develop technology and the ones that use it can help everyday people satisfy their needs more quickly, more cheaply, and more responsibly. I have a passion for technology and using them to help people and businesses.  For me, developing technology wisely is the most peaceful path to reshaping the economy. <br>
    <br>
    Before moving to the states, I worked at Ernst and Young for several years.  I built business models and valuation analysis for the Transaction Advisory Services department. Our clients included The Coca Cola Co., Ford Motors Company, Liberty and local corporations. My career was on track, but at the end of the day, I saw my self with a narrow worldview and doing almost nothing to change those things that I consider are wrong. Rather than putting them to work for some of the worlds largest corporations, I wanted to take the skills I had learned at EY plus computer programming and use them to help smaller businesses to become more sustainable, responsible and efficient. <br>
    <br>
    Since moving to Arizona with my gringa wife, Laura, we have started working as business consultants.  Some of my projects include building financial models for a small solar company, and managing the ERP for another client in Chile who is using our service to improve all aspects of their business, including working capital management. I keep in contact with my former bosses at EY, who have also since started working for them selves, and can freelance for their Chilean clients as easily as those in the US.  In order to meet the needs of my new clients, the next step in my career is becoming a web developer. When not pursuing this goal, I might be found playing the guitar and the ukulele, playing soccer, skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, climbing, hiking, doing yoga, meditating or working in the garden.<br>
