    <h1>Conflicts can be Good</h1> <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      I like emotional conflicts when they are deep and meaningful. Im not scared to face one of these ones because I try to approach them calm. Few times Ive found my self, calm like a lake in a summer morning, while someone is really angry gelling at me. Some others yes, I can feel the adrenaline.</br>
      </br>
      Sounds weird but I grew up in a small town in Argentina, where emotional conflicts and people solving them by screaming and going super loud with their body language was something normal. Something we deal with every single day and pretty much everywhere. At school or the super market.At the plaza or OMG at a soccer field.</br>
      <br>
      Because of that I realized that when I had to solve a conflict or I was in the middle of one I used to let it go to it extreme.</br>
      </br> 
      Now I know is not healthy. I dont do it any more, even knowing that the lesson can be better if that happened.</br>
      </br>
      I lived for 3 years with 3 brothers in an apartment in Santiago. We became really good friends and I was kind of the 4th brother.</br>
      </br>
      One of my friends was getting ready to move from Santiago to New York after an intense period of an internship in a bank.</br>
      <br>
      In that same period of time I was experimenting something that is hard to describe but kind of realizing how much damage I was doing to my self by the way I was eating, drinking, parting and dealing with some social interactions and my friends where kind of worry about me. Why Seba is not drunk?</br>
      </br>
      My friends, being at that time close-minded to his perspective didnt understand any of my point of views.</br>
      Right before he left our country was in the middle of the biggest student strike and the smell of family and friend getting divided by political and social schools of thought was in the air again.Coming back from the 70s.</br>
      So, whenever we have any political, social, environmental conversation I tried to use the most extreme arguments to talk to my friend. I was trying to make the point that even thinking different friends and family shouldnt take this emotionally because that was dangerous.</br> 
      </br>
      But my friend insisted in argue instead of debating.</br> 
      </br>
      One night, tired of my friend, I just look him in the eyes and ask him to move ASAP to NYC and stay there plus some other ironic and hurtful things.</br> 
      </br>
      That was very bad, bad decision. </br>
      </br>
      I learned that there are some topics that each one can choose to have an opinion about it and others that your mind set is actually set by circumstances, family, culture and there is nothing wrong with it.</br>
      I learned that tolerance is a must in any relation and even a neutral position can be offensive for others.</br>
      Days went by and we had the chance to talk, this time to say good-bye. I told him that I was intentionally provoking him whenever he was talking about those topics, just to give him a face of somebody who respect him and love him but thinks different.</br>
      I told him that in a workplace like NYC the diversity of people, culture and opinions require a bigger range of tolerance from my perspective.</br>
      And even being something that I thought it could help him, was my opinion and I didnt have the right to bring it out the way I did.</br>
      </br>
      I apologize and learned.</br>
      </br>
      Today I looked back and a sober, open and real conversation about those topics can really help. Trying to give some one a life lesson is not something that a friend should try to do the way I did. I think it&#146;s selfish at the end of the day and absolutely puts in risk any friendship.</br>
