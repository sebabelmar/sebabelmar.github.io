    <h1>I&#39m a Stereotype and that&#39s OK</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Before telling you how I went from a normal kid, to the &#34Chilean&#34 kid, from the &#34Chilean&#34 kid to the &#34Argentine&#34 teen. From the &#34Catholic white man&#34 to the &#34Non-Mormon Alien allowed to work&#34 and finally from the &#34tall white financial analyst&#34 to the &#34short Latino&#34 in the US, we need to go through some definitions:<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Social Identity</strong>: The part of the personal identity, our sense of who we are, that comes from our group membership and the social categories to which we belong: our age, sex, race, social class, political affiliation, etc, etc, etc. In programming terms a class attribute. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Effects of Identity Contingency</b>: an identity contingency is a situation where a person has an identity and this fact becomes a threat in the way that person understands his or her reality in compression with others without the identity. This can affect the comfort levels and performance pressure that a person feels in a specific situation, impacting the result of any decision taking process or any other mental or physical process. In programming terms an object behavior. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Steoreotype threat</b>: is an Identity Contingency that is not trigger because a person has low self-esteem or is mentally or physically weak that can not handle a specific situation but by the intention to do not confirm or fall into a particular set of ideas or believes pre define by the society or a group. I have not programming term for this. <br>
        <br>
        All that said I know that I put tag on people. Or I create instance of a specific class in my mind when judging someone or a group in general or specific situations. Not because I like to do it but seems to be a subconscious defense mechanism that I got by default.  Some how I need to feel secure or at least that I understand what is going in on, where I can play my game or where is the closest exit. And that way it seems that I keep my heart beats in a regular rhythm and my amygdala functioning to help me. <br>
        <br>
        Walking around judging and &#34creating instances&#34 of any class that I have in my mind, defined by my personal previous experiences or because some how some hegemonic something put them in there is not fair for any part. And even more, is a big irresponsibility from my side, is a passive way to interpret my reality and is far away from being present. <br>
        <br>
        My personal experience in the matter is rich.<br>
        Some wired stereotype related phrases I got and situations: <br>
        <br>
        &#34Hey Chilean boy, you guys don&#39t get sad when loosing in soccer because you don&#39t know how it feels to win a world cup&#34, told me somebody when trying to become a decent soccer player living in Argentina. <br>
        <br>
        &#34Hey, is hard for you to give up in a discussion because as an Argentine you think you are always right&#34, told me a Chilean in high school when I went back to live in Chile. <br>
        <br>
        &#34You are such a guilty hard worker, classic catholic Latino&#34, told me someone in Utah. <br>
        <br>
        Or the that moment that I have to look at the mirror and realize that guy was not a tall white man any more, now is an middle size Latino. And on top of that an Alien allowed to work. <br>
        <br>
        I think I learned to deal with all this stereotypical tagging since I was a kid. 
        I always tried to be positive, to not consciously judge anybody and be open minded but I never thought of how that could have conditioned my performance and worldview. Actually now that I think back, YES!, all this situations motivated or affected me in a negative way. <br>
        <br>
        For example, I had to demonstrate that I could be a good soccer player being Chilean when living in Argentina, and I worked hard. Then as the &#34Chileans&#34 soccer player, the stereotype made me feel nervous when shooting a penalty or playing as a goalie.  Back in Chile as the Argentinean now, the stereotype helped me the other way around! <br>
        <br>
        Now as a DBC student, I got a scholarship because I&#39m Latino and I think is so true that the stereotypical threat can become nothing if the environment is safe and it values diversity. <br>
        <br>
        I can feel it when pair programming because all the topics that we are learning are hard by its nature and sometimes is really hard for me to verbalize and communicate them well. There is a part of me that deals with my identity contingency but there is an other part that makes me feel safe and supported. <br>
        <br>
        DBC is by far the most diverse environment I ever been and is teaching me a lot of how to do not prejudge any body including my self. I&#39m getting in touch with that subconscious set of ideas and believe that somebody or myself inserted in my head. <br>
        <br>
        I can say that my heart is far away from that internal dialog so I feel that all this will be part of my personal and professional growth experience.
