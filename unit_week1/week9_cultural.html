    <h1>Feedback Love</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        During this last 8 weeks I&#39ve received and gave feedback in a frequency that I never done before. It feels great an it shapes the way I flow.<br>
        <br>
        I remember on my 3rd year working at Ernst and Young we had the international Feedback year. Being EY a multinational consulting group whit 100,000 employees and a strict pyramidal structure they invest a lot of resources teaching about feedback through seminars in hotels to webinars. I have to say that that experience opened me to identify any &#39Trigger&#39: TRUTH, RELATIONSHIP, and IDENTITY.<br>
        <br>
        The fact that I had previous training even in body language when giving and receiving feedback does not mean that I&#39m a feedback ninja. But a little more aware of my feeling, sorting, filtering, experimenting, and not taking things personal, etc.<br>
        <br>
        I found that at DBC feedback is more useful when it is given right away, or as soon as possible. We are a generation that is getting use to instant satisfaction but that is not the only reason, I think it&#39s because we are doing so many things a day that feedback when that challenge it’s still fresh is better.<br>
        <br>
        Comparing a cohort mate&#39s feedback provided the same day of the pair session to one about a challenge that I wrote two weeks ago, the first one it&#39s easier to internalize all it’s there easy to filter and let the process reshape my behavior or learn new tricks. A feedback with delay requires a little more effort to go over the challenge and code, kind of remember feelings and frustrations that are hopefully written on the reflection and then take things out from there in combination to the feedback.<br>
        <br>
        Feedback is the way to grow and learn, it is what makes this alternative educational experience possible. On Phase 0 I&#39ve learned more from my cohort mates feedback that from instructors. The more feedback I give, and I think writing issues on Github is my favorite, the more I contribute to the co-creation of this crazy experience.<br>
        <br>
        The more specific, kind and actionable my feedback is, the better for me and for everybody at DBC.<br>
        <br>
        Giving meaningful positive feedback is a responsibility that we all have; it doesn&#39t require much more effort than being present and empathetic. Give to someone something with the same standards you will like to receive from him or her.<br>
        <br>
        Meta feedback have putted me back in track after some experiments, issues on github teaches me and makes me aware that there is always someone reading, pair session feedback reshapes my behaviors and lot of time I can show them with a smile in my face.<br>
        <br>
        Feedback as waxing my snowboard, pumping my MTB wheels, or checking my rock climbing rope prepares me to face the elements. And like tuning my guitar, makes the whole experience more harmonic.
