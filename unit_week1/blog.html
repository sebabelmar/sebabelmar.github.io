            <h3>Comparing Web sites</h3>
            <br>
            <h4><a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a></h4>
            Is one of my favorites websites because it let me discover shorts and documentaries that I could never find other way. It is easy to use and they have staff picking good material and artists for you. Their recommendations are fantastic and usually takes your to some unexplored corner of reality or fantasy.<br>
            I love the elegant way that the videos Meta data is displayed and how people really interact around it.<br>
            Vimeo makes my day several times a week.<br>
            Compare to Youtube I find Vimeo more relaxing to use, less add, less consumer hunting oriented and really whiling to help artists to improve or people to start doing good art.

            <br/>
            <h4><a href="http://liftinteractive.com/">Liftinteractive</a></h4>
            These guys came up with an awesome way to use CSS. They are an agency and they are trying to educate their clients on what they do.<br> 
            They make it really simple, elegant and pretty. I feel really engage with this guys vision and mission just by putting my eyes on their index. A full-page picture showing the culture, relax environment and professionalism.<br>
            They use the word LEARN. Learn more about us. Study us. Hire us.<br>
            I like their simplicity and the way they display their information. Their colors are not dark at all and matches with their life style or a least with my interpretation of it.

            <br/>
            <h4><a href="http://www.sedonahotyoga.com/">Sedona Hot Yoga</a></h4>
            I use this website every week to check on schedule, classes, teachers and if there are any cancelation. Thats why is one of my favorites; they update it every week at least two times. And they have a Mobil version!<br>
            But their colors scheme is terrible. It stress me out, I dont like vising this website but I have to. I think it has basic design and it doesnt engage. For me it doesnt communicate their values as a yoga studio.<br>
            The way they display information is has a huge lack of elegancy.
