            <h3>JavaScript != JAVA</h3>
            <br>
            - Ahhhhh... your IPA on tap please. 24oz. </br>
            - Well while we wait for the 3rd wheel do you want to hear something that will blow your mind? </br>
            </br>
            JavaScript it is a really popular programming language!
            </br>
            Let me tell you why. 
            </br>
            </br>
            First JAVA is not JavaScript. They are different breads.</br>
            </br>
            Java is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language">Compiled</a> programming language and JavaScript is a, guess... yes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">Scripting</a> one.</br>
            The difference between Compiled and Scripting is huge.</br> 
            </br>
            When you use a compiling language your code has to be compiled by a special program call compiler.</br> A compiler changes your code into a language that machine can understand. With a compiler language you dont run the code that you make but the result of the compiled process, which is a new file. A new file delivered from the compiler. Confused???</br>
            </br>
            On the other hand, with Scripting language you dont need a compiler but you need an interpreter. Every browser is an interpreter and they can easily read line-by-line code that you write in JavaScript and work with it.</br>
            </br>
            With a compiler you need to run separate compile process for Windows, Mac or Linux, but you can run JavaScript on any browser and it does not matter in which OS.</br>
            </br>
            My friend dont you think I could be the most popular guy if I speak one language that girls of any culture can understand??</br>
            </br>
            And in top of that, you can do <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/things-you-didnt-know-javascript-could-do-6122835">all this kind of things</a> using JavaScript, which by the way, is an Object Oriented programming language easy to learn and light to run.

            <h3>Values === Hapiness</h3>
            </br>
            I see happiness as way to go, as a state of mind that I can choose and not as something that I have to achieve. I can feel exited, motivated and think that, that is happiness or I can miss my family and think that Im feeling unhappy.</br>
            </br>
            But in order be or go happy, I think I have to create the conditions to that. 
            Creating those conditions makes me feel proud and by the pillars that sustain my pride I can go to sleep satisfied.
            I can remember moments of my life that all those factors came together and collide in one event or day, like my wedding.  Or like the day I knew my wife was pregnant or the first time I heard my babys heart beating.</br>
            </br>
            This are some of values that help me create conditions to go happy in life:</br>
            </br>
            Wisdom</br>
            Responsibility</br>
            Close Relationships</br>
            Community</br>
            Creativity</br>
            Nature</br>

            </br>
            I feel that RESPONSIBILITY is one of the values that keeps me calm, focus, secure and let me go happy. When I assume the responsibility of my decisions I can die happy doing what Ive decided to do. I know that Ive chosen the right path that leads me to where my heart wants to go. I might be wrong, but I have that milestone to go back to, and re evaluate if Im in the right path. All this because there was a point back there in time, that I consciously decided to load my back pack with that RESPONSIBILITY and it will be always available for me.</br>
            </br>
            One thing is to say, and other one is to do. I try but actually I live those values in a scale 1-5 like this:</br>
            </br>
            Wisdom 3</br>
            Responsibility 4</br>
            Close Relationships 4</br>
            Community 3</br>
            Creativity 4</br>
            Nature 4</br>
            </br>
            Because there are some values that is hard to work on or to actually achieve, plus 5 is perfection and I dont have to be perfect :)</br>
            </br>
            </br>
            Do you want to know the last topic that someone asked me advice on?</br>
            </br>
            YOGA; one of my friend was going to different YOGA classes, different teachers and different kinds of YOGA. He asked me what was my opinion on Kundalini Yoga.
            Iâ€™ve practice a lot of Kundalini with different teachers from different parts of the world. So we had a nice open conversation about it and he got my perspective on that topic.

            <h3>Comparing Web sites</h3>
            <br>
            <h4><a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a></h4>
            Is one of my favorites websites because it let me discover shorts and documentaries that I could never find other way. It is easy to use and they have staff picking good material and artists for you. Their recommendations are fantastic and usually takes your to some unexplored corner of reality or fantasy.<br>
            I love the elegant way that the videos Meta data is displayed and how people really interact around it.<br>
            Vimeo makes my day several times a week.<br>
            Compare to Youtube I find Vimeo more relaxing to use, less add, less consumer hunting oriented and really whiling to help artists to improve or people to start doing good art.

            <br/>
            <h4><a href="http://liftinteractive.com/">Liftinteractive</a></h4>
            These guys came up with an awesome way to use CSS. They are an agency and they are trying to educate their clients on what they do.<br> 
            They make it really simple, elegant and pretty. I feel really engage with this guys vision and mission just by putting my eyes on their index. A full-page picture showing the culture, relax environment and professionalism.<br>
            They use the word LEARN. Learn more about us. Study us. Hire us.<br>
            I like their simplicity and the way they display their information. Their colors are not dark at all and matches with their life style or a least with my interpretation of it.

            <br/>
            <h4><a href="http://www.sedonahotyoga.com/">Sedona Hot Yoga</a></h4>
            I use this website every week to check on schedule, classes, teachers and if there are any cancelation. Thats why is one of my favorites; they update it every week at least two times. And they have a Mobil version!<br>
            But their colors scheme is terrible. It stress me out, I dont like vising this website but I have to. I think it has basic design and it doesnt engage. For me it doesnt communicate their values as a yoga studio.<br>
            The way they display information is has a huge lack of elegancy.
