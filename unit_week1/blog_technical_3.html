    <h1>LOOPS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>        
      If there is something that computer programmers like to do not do, it is to repeat the same thing several times.</br>
      </br>
      That is why from the very beginning this was kind of the whole point of creating computers. Why calculating this over and over again?? </br>
      what if we teach a dog how to do it. </br>
      </br>
      Well instead of dog training, humans created computers. It was easy to fall in an infinite loop back in the day and end up unplugging the dog to stop it. </br>
      </br>
      Today Ruby makes looping easy and intuitive.</br>
      </br>
      LOOPS: execute the same block of code a specific number of times.</br>
      </br>
      SYNTAX OF SOME LOOPS</br>
      </br>
      While: executes code while conditional is true.</br>
      </br>
      while conditional [do]   </br> 
        code </br>
      end</br>
      </br>

      Until: executes code while conditional is false.</br>
      </br>
      until conditional [do]   </br> 
        code</br> 
      end</br>
      </br>

      For: executes code once for each element in the expression.</br>
      </br>
      for variable [, variable ...] in expression [do]  </br>  
        code </br>
      end</br>
      </br>

      The challenge here is to define the specific number of times that we want to execute and obviously what code the want to be executed.</br>
      </br>
      Which one to use will depend on how do you like to set the conditional and just execute some code (while, until), if you are going to loop over a </br>
      Hash or an Array without creating  new scope for local variables (for) or if you want to execute related to a sequence of numbers (for).</br>
      </br>
      The statement above is just an interpretation you can experiment with them, but as important it is to understand how this different </br>
      loops work is to understand what iterator variables and the conditionals are:</br>
      </br>
      Defining and understanding iterators;</br>
      An iterator is a variable that will increase or decrees in order to count how many times the code has been repeated.</br>
      This variable usually define equal to 0 or 1 outside the loop and increase =+ 1 every time the code is executed. Is not weird to use it </br>
      counting backwards or counting in a different scale. But the final idea is to use this in the conditional that stops the loop and some times in the </br>
      code that you want to execute i (iterators) times.</br>
      </br>
      Defining and understanding conditional;</br>
      Loops go on until the conditional is true or false. This is why you use the iterator and a conditional when setting up a loop.</br>
      On loops like each they stop when they have no more elements to pass into the code so we can say they have an automatic break.</br>
      Break, redo, retry, next and retry_if are statements that you can use inside your loops in order to control its performance giving </br>
      you some independence from the conditional.
