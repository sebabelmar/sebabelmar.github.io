			Getting ready with HTML while remembering LOGO
		</h1>

		<h4 class="content">Past</h4>
		<p class="content">
			When I was a kid I used to play with <b> <a id="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">LOGO</a></b>. <br> I learned at school in our computer programming class!
		</p>

		<h3 class="content">Past-Present</h3>
		<p class="content">
			LOGO is fun!! and <i><b>6 year old kids</b></i> can play with it. <br> I remember that we use to pair and write code in order to learn about geomerical shapes!! Our teacher drew on the chalk board and we made that on our computers :). Well I never meet <a id="link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPd44Zz6etI" target="_self"><i>this guy</i></a> or even someone like <a id="link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkd9TWUtFm0" target="_self"><i> this other</i> </a>.... so I stop programming. 
		</p> 

		<h2 class="content">Present-Future</h2>
		<p class="content">
			Now, just a few weeks from start coding in pairs I got that memorie. <br> To make the point, computer programming <b>helps</b> humans of any age to learn how to learn, to share, to solve problems in groups and to have fun in the porcess. <br> It is something that any body deserves to learn. I think each public and private school should teach it.
