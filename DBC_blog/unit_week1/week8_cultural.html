    <h1>Creative Mode</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Living in the world of ideas and of dreams coming true and becoming part of our material world I&#39ve realized that is common to perceive two clear things; projections and reflections.<br>
        <br>
        A projection comes from a source and a reflection is a projection that is &#39not&#39 connected to the source anymore but it bounces around as a constant that gets distorted. Ex. DBC under the vision of its founder versus other Code School that just tries to follow the trend.<br>
        <br>
        Depending on the source the projection can be better, more clear and sustainable; in time and space than the reflection.  The reflection is not more that a constant, it bounces around without much sense, but sometimes that reflection feeds the creativity of an other source and is in these cases that we have again a new projection. This can be DBC model inspiring an other Code School founder or members to have a new vision and dream and project that.<br>
        <br>
        DBC is the projection of a dream, of a clear vision. Where we are all invited to project it, not just reflect it and in order to do that each one of us have to become a creative source.<br>
        <br>
        Being a creative source is not a passive roll, is not consuming and throwing away. It is completely the opposite, it&#39s and active roll. It comes with a huge responsibility, the better my projection the better DBC&#39s and vise versa. And it is why I want to become a developer.<br>
        <br>
        What part of the essence of DBC I&#39m going to be able to internalize, and make it part of me in order to carry it around as a torch? I have no idea but I&#39ll keep that intuitive process to that part of me that have nothing to do with words and languages. But I'll do my best to co-create the experience and became a contrubution to it.<br>
        <br>
        DBC was the last Code School I applied, I knew about these schools throw a person in North Carolina (DBC was not in the list)... and it was not until I started reading Quora that DBC pop to my top of mind.<br>
        <br>
        The name kind of rejected me because the warlike concept behind, but the video on the web was the key. I just want to make the point that the conviction of DBC&#39s founder, his idea and the way he us inviting us to project it was all I need it to feel.<br>
        <br>
        I can&#39t be more exited to be part of this experiment. I&#39ve met great people so far and I have had an incredible time.<br>
        <br>
        Now it is time to make this next 9 weeks, my next 9 weeks. Own them and share them. Plus don&#39t just like them but love them.<br>
