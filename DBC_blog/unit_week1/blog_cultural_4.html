      <p>
        The apps of the future are here. This new apps integrates SaaS (Software as Service) as the delivery model.
        No more wrapping a software and making the user adapt to it. The transition from buy at the Mobil App 
        to a model that integrates a more hands-on customer service seems to be part of the next generation on software.<br>
        <br>
        As part of the new philosophies and may be the most cutting hedge one is the incorporation of cognitive science.
        Incorporating cognitive science is trying to reshape where the human being belongs in businesses structures, and
        actually making them be part of those activities where we add more value.
        Having humans relocated, technology started to help us in that area delivering instant intelligence.<br>
        <br>
        The issue, is to spread and teach this new way to engineer technology, integrate it in the society and develop it.
        And when that happens we will see again concentration of knowledge, capital, companies, and people who create and developed technology in developed economies.<br>
        <br>
        The dependency, of countries in Latin America and other less developed economies, to this imported technologies reduce the 
        oportunities to innovate and to adapt it to the local reality.<br>
        <br>
        How to solve this problem; TEACHING.<br>
        <br>
        The only way that we are going to be able to localize software and more now that the next generation seems to have
        the human mind in a big consideration will be by incorporating technology development studies in more levels and
        sectors inside different societies.
        Programming boot camps and tutorials in different countries and languages is going to be a huge part of this revolution.
