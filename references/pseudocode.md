### Pseudocode

Based on the tests, you should have an idea of what your method(s) need(s) to accomplish.
In the pseudocode section of your `my_solution.rb` file, identify the input and output. 
Then write specific step-by-step ideas in code-like English to pass each test. 
Each line should be something you can easily translate into code. 
For help with writing pseudocode, take a look at this [pseudocode standard](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html) example.

*NOTE: Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.*
