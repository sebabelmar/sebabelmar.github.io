### Initial Solution

Translate your pseudocode into code. If your pseudocode 
is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. 

You will encounter challenges where you need to write your own tests and others where tests will be written for you in RSpec. 

You should write your own tests. Always begin coding by running your tests. What do they return? Do they all fail?

When you think your code should pass the first failing test, either:
1. Run the spec file again using the `rspec` command if the tests are in RSpec.
2. Run the file with your driver test code. 

If your solution passes your first test(s), work on translating the next bit of pseudocode to pass the next test. 

If it fails, try to figure out why it's still failing and modify
your code accordingly.

When you've passed each test, give yourself a pat on the back! Then take a break before trying to refactor. It's good to give your eyes a rest so they can more easily see places to improve.
