### Refactoring

When you return to your solution. Ask yourself:
- Are the variable names you've chosen clear? (see [Tips for Naming Variables](http://www.makinggoodsoftware.com/2009/05/04/71-tips-for-naming-variables/))
- Is the code concise (but readable)? See [Code Smells](http://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/) FYI: When he refers to "shorter methods" think of them 
  as not necessarily short in terms of lines, but having a single thing to do. Avoid chaining too many methods together or having too much logic on one line.
- Is the code [D.R.Y](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don't_Repeat_Yourself)? 

If you can't think of a way to improve your code, write why you think it's great instead. Do not simply copy the initial solution or leave this section blank.
